> *“Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you” – Misty Copeland* 

I was in my 8th Standard when Kalyan Uncle and Akila Aunty became our next-door neighbours. And from the start itself, they were there as guiding lights to me and my family. Any doubts I had, be it with respect to academics or personal life, Aunty had become my go to person. Aunty and Uncle’s guidance played a big role in me choosing my junior college in Mumbai. It was because of this decision, that I became an extrovert and understood the importance of building a good network. They gave me the confidence to expand my boundaries at an early age, which I wouldn’t have done on my own.

Aunty and Uncle played a major role in helping me decide my career post junior college. Engineering is an expensive degree, and it was with Aunty and Uncle’s financial support that I could do engineering and complete it with flying colours. I will never forget those days, when they backed me and gave me the confidence to go ahead and study. They believed in me and my capabilities, when no one else believed in the same.

I believe it is their presence during my initial and later years, which has made me reach this stage in life, where in I am confident about my future and am optimistic about fulfilling my goals. Uncle and Aunty are still my go-to people whenever I need guidance and I know they will always be there as guiding lights to me and my family.

Vandith and Vaanchitha are like my brother and sister and they have been gifted with the same benevolent nature as their parents. It has been a wonderful journey growing up together.

I consider the Kalyanaramans as part of my family and wherever I go, they will always have a special place in my heart.

As it is said, “No matter how far you are in a tunnel, there will always be light at the end!” Thank you, Uncle and Aunty, for being the light at the end of my tunnel of darkness. I will always be indebted to you!

Gratefully yours,

Ankit Dasgupta
