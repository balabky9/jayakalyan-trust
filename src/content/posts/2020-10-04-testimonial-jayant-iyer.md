When we talk about helping each other, it is not always necessary that we receive what we give. Sometimes, a token of gratitude that we give, can prove to be a life-changing moment for the one who receives it. This token is the reason why I saw a considerable change in my life, simultaneously giving me an opportunity to grow.

I am Srijayanth Iyer, a 22-year old who has successfully completed my graduation in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in Galaxy Surfactants, MIDC, Taloja. It was a long and tough road to reach this stage of my life, yet this is the beginning of a new phase and a fresh start in my profession.

Engineering as an education is always a costly affair. Financially, it would have proven too much for my parents since we did not have a stable and ample source of income. Initially, my father managed a college canteen for about 5 years, but due to unforeseen circumstances, he had to close the contract. In order to suffice our necessities, my mother and father started working together to run our home-made catering business, just before I was about to complete my 12th Standard. 

This whole home-made business started because of the blessings that we had received from Mrs Akila Kalyanaraman and her family. Since they were our first customer and also a great mentor, the bond that they share with us is the reason why we coped up with so many hurdles and difficulties. Right from supporting our business to funding my education through Jaykalyan Trust, words are just not enough to express how grateful I, my mother and my father are.

As this great saying depicts ‘Charity begins at home’, it would be great to witness this community grow with the contributions that everyone put in. I would feel blessed to lend a helping hand for the ones who deserve, just like one that I received from this community.
